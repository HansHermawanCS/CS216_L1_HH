**NG 2/24/2025**
* use setfill() to print the same character multiple times -1
* << not needed between strings -1
* file name(s) and/or file/folder structure/capitalization do not comply with posted instructions – 2
*  const; if it is not 1 or 0 make it const -5
* modularization: each menu option should have its own function -5
*  #68 – does not check for array boundaries; there are three arrays and each one has its own counter -5
* recursively calls menu; why? -2
* cin.ignore(…); what will happen if a use enters +1  more chars than you specified? -2
* #158- what for? -1
* average  and/or median are not accurate -2
* input/output files should be opened/closed where they are needed, in  getData() and print respectively, not in main() -2
* 70-96; redundant convoluted logic -2
* max size is 15 and array size is 20? -2
* input/output files should be opened/closed where they are needed, in  getData() and print respectively, not in main() -2
* median function should call sort -2
* readability, comments; do not state obvious, remove outdated code; comments supposed to help and not create unnecessary clutter; "Code never lies, comments sometimes do." - Ron Jeffries” ; what is the purpose of the comments as this(ese) one(s);  -2
```
  // Array variables
  int divisByFive[20];
```
* poor Id(s)  and/or inconsistent naming convention; ids should be self-documenting and as short as possible; use verbs for functions and nouns for variables; use camel-casing for variables (errorMessage) enum & const should be in upper case with words separated by “_”; pointer variables should start with p( if single)  or pp( if double pointer); flags isValid ( clearly what true would mean); if copying – e.g rhsQueue or scrQueue ; do not use IDs that are same as or very similar to C++  keywords and functions; no need to call an array “array”- it is obvious -2
```
  getData();
```
* what is the point of main with one function call?-2
* << not needed between strings -1
* empty return statement – stopped grading
